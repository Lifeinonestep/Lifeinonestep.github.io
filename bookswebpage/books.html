        	<h2>Catcher in the Rye</h2>
        	<p>Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, a boy leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it</p>
